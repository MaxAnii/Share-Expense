        <h2>Create Your ShareExpense Room</h2>
        <p>
          Collaborate with friends, family, or roommates to manage shared
          expenses effortlessly.
          <br />
          Keep track of who spends what, settle debts, and maintain financial
          clarity.

          <h3>How It Works</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Create a Room: Set up a dedicated space for tracking shared
              expenses. Give your room a name and invite others to join using
              their email addresses.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add Roommates: Invite your roommates to the room. Everyone can
              join and start contributing to expenses.
            </li>
            <li>
              Record Expenses: Whenever anyone makes a purchase, log it in the
              room. Specify who paid and who benefited from the expense.
            </li>
            <li>
              Track Balances: ShareExpense Hub automatically calculates
              individual balances, making it easy to see who owes what to whom.
            </li>
            <li>
              Create Notes: Need to remember specific details? Create notes for
              each expense to add descriptions, split costs, and add context.
            </li>
            <li>
              Settle Debts: Simplify the process of settling debts. You can
              either make direct payments or handle them outside the platform.
            </li>
          </ul>
